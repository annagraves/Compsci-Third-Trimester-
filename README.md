Space Adventure Lession 1 & 2

Questions:

-How do I save files? Are they all in main.swift?

-Swift.education seems like a lesson guide for teachers, so how do I learn swift on my own if I don't know the concepts in the "agenda?"

-Why are there so many print statements? Can't we just combine into one or does this help eliminate errors by splitting it up? 

-What is a Boolean condition? Compares 2 things 

-= vs == is assignment vs comparison 

-Why does it assume "Y" if I type "I want to stay home" for lession 2?
