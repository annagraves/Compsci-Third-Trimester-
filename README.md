Space Adventure Lession 1 & 2
Questions:
-How do I save files? Are they all in main.swift?
-Swift.education seems like a lesson guide for teachers, so how do I learn swift on my own if I don't know the concepts in the "agenda?"
-Why are there so many print statements? Can't we just combine into one or does this help eliminate errors by splitting it up? 
-What is a Boolean condition? Compares 2 things 
-= vs == is assignment vs comparison 
-Why does it assume "Y" if I type "I want to stay home" for lession 2? 
Notes:
-Allergy app
  -Filter ingredients allergy
  -Notifications when foods are mislabeled 
  -Work with FARE?
